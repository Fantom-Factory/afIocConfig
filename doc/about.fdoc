'IoC Config' is an [IoC]`pod:afIoc` library for providing injectable config values.

Config values are essentially constants, but their value can be overridden on registry startup.

This makes them great for use by 3rd party libraries.
The libraries can set sensible default values, and applications may then optionally override them.
